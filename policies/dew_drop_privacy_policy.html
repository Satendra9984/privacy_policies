        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dew Drop ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by Dew Drop.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Dew Drop is designed as a local-first application. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal hydration data on external servers. All data you enter (water intake, weight, age, activity level, etc.) is stored locally on your device.</p>

            <li><strong>Schedule Exact Alarm:</strong> To ensure reminders are delivered precisely at your preferred times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>Your data is used solely for the purpose of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculating your daily hydration goals.</li>
            <li>Tracking your progress over time.</li>
            <li>Displaying statistics and insights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase:</strong> To improve app stability and performance through anonymized usage data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since your data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can delete all your data at any time by using the "Reset All Data" option in the Settings menu or by uninstalling the application.</p>
